fluidhandler
============

Robosquirt is an automated, easy-to-assemble liquid handler that is composed of several discrete hardware and components. Fluid motion is generated by a syringe pump, which is controlled by a linear actuator. Flow is directed through appropriately-sized tubing into the deviceâ€™s nozzle, which moves to and dispenses the fluid in appropriate receptacle. The electronics controlling the system are managed by an Arduino Mega 2560. A Java UI is be used to send commands and receive feedback from the Arduino

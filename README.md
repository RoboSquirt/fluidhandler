RoboFlow
============

Welcome to the repository for RoboFlow! The RoboFlow project is intended as a low-cost, open source solution to tedious, time-consuming, or previously impossible laboratory fluid handling tasks. If this sounds useful to you, read on!

A few quick facts about RoboFlow:
- Cost less than $X
- other specs
- Software, specs, etc. all freely available here.
- Build and operate yourself. There are no pre-made kits available.

This is the main "portal" repository for RoboFlow -- the application, (etc. etc.) can be obtained by downloading this repository as a zip and unpacking it. Any questions, comments, or thoughts on the device should be directed to the [google group forums] (https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/roboflow).

All documentation for RoboFlow can be found in this repository's wiki pages. If you've decided you want to try RoboFlow for yourself, you should start off with the [Getting Started] (https://github.com/RoboSquirt/fluidhandler/wiki/Getting-Started) page.
